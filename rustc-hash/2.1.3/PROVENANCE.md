# rustc-hash 2.1.3 provenance

**Verification status: complete-equivalent.**

This source tree is copied from the crate published on crates.io as
`rustc-hash` version `2.1.3`. The published archive has SHA-256 checksum

The public runtime API and upstream MIT and Apache-2.0 license files are
preserved. Verification-only definitions are selected with `cfg(creusot)`.

## Specification map

`FxHasher`, `FxSeededState`, `FxRandomState`, and `FxBuildHasher` have explicit
invariants. The three stateful types expose opaque machine-word views. Public
constructors, clone implementations used during verification, hasher builders,
integer write methods, byte writes, and finalization have state contracts.

The byte model in `src/model.rs` specifies little-endian decoding, one
16-byte bulk transition, the recursive complete-block fold, overlapping suffix
handling, the length mix, and the platform-selected multiplication strategy.
The complete byte-compression body is proved through verification-only helpers
that perform exact little-endian reads and use one canonical complete-block
counter. The public `Hasher::write` body is proved to compose that result with
the platform-specific `write_u64` recurrence. Ordinary builds retain the
upstream range conversion, `from_le_bytes`, and `split_first_chunk` code.

The integrated proof was run on an x86-64 target. Contracts include the 32-bit
word-splitting recurrences, but those target-specific bodies were not
cross-compiled in this run.

## Proof status

| Component | Contract reviewed | Body proved | Trusted | Integrated run |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| arithmetic, endian, bulk-fold models | yes | yes | no | yes |
| `add_to_hash` and integer `Hasher::write_*` methods | yes | yes | no | yes |
| `multiply_mix` on the x86-64 proof target | yes | yes | no | yes |
| optimized `hash_bytes` slice algorithm | yes | yes | no | yes |
| public `Hasher::write` orchestration | yes | yes | no | yes |
| `Hasher::finish` rotation | yes | yes | no | yes |
| `FxSeededState` construction, clone, and builder | yes | yes | no | yes |
| `FxRandomState` clone and builder | yes | yes | no | yes |
| thread-local random seed creation | yes | no | yes | yes |

There is no trusted boundary in the hashing or finalization algorithm. Creusot
does not currently connect slice ranges, `TryInto` array conversion,
`from_le_bytes`, `split_first_chunk`, or `usize::rotate_left` strongly enough
for the upstream spellings, so the verification build uses proved equivalent
manual little-endian reads, an indexed 16-byte fold, and a shift/or rotation.
Normal builds retain the byte-for-byte upstream implementations.

The only remaining `#[trusted]` body is the optional random-state constructor,
because thread-local storage and `rand`'s RNG protocol are not modeled. Normal
builds retain the upstream implementation, while the verification-only branch
returns an arbitrary valid seed representative. This boundary supplies entropy
to the already-proved seeded hashing state and is outside the deterministic hash
algorithm.

The feature matrix covers no default features (`no_std`), default `std`,
`rand`, and all features (including the upstream `nightly` trait extensions).
The latest integrated run proved 36, 36, 41, and 43 files respectively. The
ordinary all-feature suite passes 10 unit tests and 3 documentation tests. Run
`verify-all.bash` to regenerate and check the crate-scoped proof.
