# Repository instructions

## Keep verification scoped to the requested crate

Each `crates/<name>/<version>` directory is an independent verification target.
When adding or changing support for a crate, run checks only for the crate named
in the request unless the user explicitly asks for repository-wide validation.

- Run the target crate's `verify-all.bash` when it exists.
- Otherwise run `./verify.bash crates/<name>/<version>` from the repository root.
- Run Cargo commands from the target crate directory or pass its exact
  `--manifest-path`. Do not run workspace-wide or repository-wide Cargo commands.
- Do not loop over other directories under `crates/`, and do not use failures from
  other verified crates to judge whether the target crate passes.
- If a command unexpectedly checks or reports another crate, stop using that
  command and rerun the narrow equivalent for the requested crate. Ignore the
  unrelated result; do not fix unrelated crates without an explicit request.
- A shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` may reuse or rebuild dependencies. Compiling a shared
  dependency such as `creusot-std` is expected and does not mean that another
  crate's proof or test suite was run.
- Changes under `creusot-libs/` are allowed when the target proof needs a missing
  standard-library contract. Validate the target crate and only the minimum
  directly relevant library build or test; do not reverify every existing crate.
- Keep status reports precise: say which crate, version, and feature configuration
  was checked. Do not imply repository-wide verification from a crate-scoped run.

## Run Why3 proof processes outside the sandbox

Why3/`why3find` proof execution uses Unix-domain socket communication that is
blocked by the filesystem sandbox in this environment. Proof commands must be
requested with unsandboxed/elevated execution on the first attempt rather than
waiting for a sandbox failure.

This applies to commands that invoke the proof phase, including:

- `cargo creusot ... prove`
- `./verify.bash ...`
- a crate-local `verify-all.bash`
- direct `why3find prove` or Why3 server commands

Translation or ordinary Rust build steps that do not start Why3 may remain in the
sandbox. Errors such as `Unix.Unix_error(Unix.EPERM, "bind", ...)`, socket
bind/connect failures, or inability to start the Why3 proof server are environment
failures, not failed proof obligations. Rerun the same target-scoped proof command
outside the sandbox and report the proof result from that run.
