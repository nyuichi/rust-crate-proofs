# fixedbitset 0.5.7 provenance and verification scope

**Verification status: broad public state-machine API (partial).**

This source tree is the published `fixedbitset` 0.5.7 crate. Its
`.cargo_vcs_info.json` records upstream revision
`f1db5d17dabc4b8f3ba68c1228a3ee7601c7f33c`. The `creusot-std` dependency,
Creusot-facing state machine, `why3find.json`, verification script, this file,
and the source-only module rearrangement are repository-local additions.
Ordinary builds select the complete upstream implementation with
`cfg(not(creusot))`; the all-feature upstream suite passes 63 unit tests and
7 documentation tests.

## Specification map

The mathematical model is a finite `Seq<bool>`. Its length is the bitset's
fixed length, and element `i` is the enabled state of bit `i`. The public
`FixedBitSet` invariant bounds that sequence length by `usize::MAX`.

The verified core contracts are:

- `new`, `default`, and `with_capacity`: exact length and initially-clear bits;
- `len`, `is_empty`, `is_clear`, `is_full`, `contains`, `minimum`, and
  `maximum`: exact observations, including the upstream rule that out-of-range
  membership is false and exact least/greatest enabled-bit witnesses;
- `clear`, `insert`, `remove`, `put`, `toggle`, `set`, and `copy_bit`: exact
  element-wise sequence transitions;
- `contains_unchecked`, `insert_unchecked`, `remove_unchecked`,
  `put_unchecked`, `toggle_unchecked`, `set_unchecked`, and
  `copy_bit_unchecked`: the same exact observations and transitions under the
  unsafe APIs' required in-range preconditions;
- `grow`: preserved old prefix, exact non-shrinking length, and clear new suffix;
- `grow_and_insert`: composition of growth with a single enabled bit;
- `count_ones` and `count_zeroes`: exact cardinalities for all four built-in
  half-open range forms (`..`, `a..`, `..b`, and `a..b`);
- `set_range`, `insert_range`, `remove_range`, and `toggle_range`: exact
  element-wise transitions inside the normalized range with every outside bit
  preserved;
- `contains_all_in_range` and `contains_any_in_range`: exact universal and
  existential range predicates, including empty ranges;
- `is_disjoint`, `is_subset`, and `is_superset`: exact finite-set relations,
  treating out-of-range positions as disabled;
- `union_with`, `intersect_with`, `difference_with`, and
  `symmetric_difference_with`: exact element-wise finite-set transitions and
  their capacity effects;
- `union_count`, `intersection_count`, `difference_count`, and
  `symmetric_difference_count`: exact cardinalities of the corresponding
  zero-extended finite-set combinations.
- `Clone`/`clone_from`, `PartialEq`/`Eq`, and indexing: exact sequence copying,
  sequence equality, and zero-extended bit lookup;
- `&`, `|`, `^`, `&=`, `|=`, and `^=` operator adapters: exact element-wise
  results, including the upstream minimum/maximum result-length rules and both
  owned and borrowed assignment operands.

The proof architecture is:

```text
grow_and_insert / copy_bit
  -> grow / contains / set / insert
  -> Seq<bool> element update
  -> Vec<bool> verification representation
```

`--no-default-features`, default features, and `--all-features`.

## Explicit boundary and removal condition

The upstream implementation stores aligned SIMD blocks behind a
`NonNull<MaybeUninit<SimdBlock>>`, reconstructs `Vec`s from raw parts, exposes
reinterpreted `usize` slices, and dispatches to architecture-specific block
types. Current Creusot cannot translate and prove that ownership and
initialization representation compositionally. Consequently, `cfg(creusot)`
uses a `Vec<bool>` state machine. This establishes the listed public transition
contracts and their composition, but does not prove that the upstream raw
pointer/SIMD bodies refine the Boolean sequence model.

Remove the representation boundary after the raw allocation has a proved
initialized-length invariant and each SIMD block operation has a bit-for-bit
refinement lemma.

Raw block construction/slices and block-level counting, lazy one/zero and
set-algebra iterators, iterator-based `Extend`/`FromIterator`, formatting,
hashing, ordering, serde, and drops remain outside the current verification
interface. Proving the iterator family next requires a separate `IteratorSpec`
layer that relates each iterator state to the remaining selected indices,
including independent front/back progress relations for double-ended
iteration. The remaining APIs are retained unchanged in ordinary builds and
exercised by the upstream tests where applicable. The ordinary all-feature
suite passes 63 integration tests and 7 documentation tests.
