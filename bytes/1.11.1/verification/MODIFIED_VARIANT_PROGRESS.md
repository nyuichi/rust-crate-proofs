# Modified bytes 1.11.1: validated increments

The selected modified API is not yet complete. These are integrated production
body proofs under the pinned generic allocation/atomic/library boundary, not
proofs of legacy API compatibility or additional configurations.

## Scoped sharing tree (52)

`tree-final-52` has 52 Coma files, 52 proof results, zero null leaves; every
archive member hash was independently checked. Archive SHA-256:
`45c634540046cb8f0acbedc3a47569bc5e8c4886d0486dc0a84a4a81b30c8379`.

`scoped_tree` creates actual recursive scoped threads for any finite requested
leaf count >= 2. Each node uses a two-child retirement counter and restores its
parent lease; this is a hierarchy, not a flat arbitrary-N refcount or escaping
Clone API. Counts 0/1 explicitly detach and clean up the input allocation.
Native coverage includes 180 tree cases and the existing lifecycle/race tests.
Read counts denote attempts; out-of-range attempts return None.

Proofs cover normal-return executions, byte contents, affine lease recovery and
exact final consuming cleanup. Thread termination, panic/unwind cleanup,
allocation failures, no_std and other platforms remain separate obligations.
There are no new trusted bytes-specific protocol contracts.

## Ordinary exclusive mutation composed with sharing (67)

`phase2-final-67`: 67 Coma files, 67 proof results, zero null leaves.
Independently checked archive SHA-256:
`4e4ec667416b1300098cb7e46565c94568740587a013c8edd69a508d069eabd2`.

ExclusiveBytes uses an ordinary Vec with checked reads/writes, push/pop,
truncate/resize, reserve operations and explicit consuming cleanup.
`scoped_set_and_read` connects ordinary mutation to the same physical allocation's
shared reads and cleanup. Native tests include 411 lifecycle cases, exclusive
operation sequences and the atomic race test. Reserve specifications preserve
contents; numeric capacity guarantees remain unproved.

The missing tree-anchor negative retains one failed proof result: archive
`7d7d2f646994425f415f65f714d0c6d7dd15704a6c85fb37c180c8b28c83fcc6`.
An ordinary mutation attempted only inside ghost code is rejected at translation
(the erased native execution retains 7 rather than the claimed 9):
`3a4356fe1c92111a1911b027f924b2e2ddbc01cb31f32a4e1dd7d052921eeb37`.
These negatives are independently hash-checked and preserved, not passing proofs.
